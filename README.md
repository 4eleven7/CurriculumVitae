### Experience

#### Burberry
*11/15 - 02/16*   
**Swift**, tvOS,  XCTest, Storyboards, AVKit, IBInspectable   
Lead developer (on a team of 2) on [Burberry App for Apple TV](http://www.burberryplc.com/media_centre/press_releases/2016/burberry_launches_on_apple_tv).   

Burberry's first ever app.   
Liaised and met regularly with Apple UK to create a bespoke Apple TV app.   
Featured completely custom interface, with interactive transitions, live event countdown/stream, and a custom video player (split screen product details with video loops). Built with test driven development, and using Storyboards to reduce the amount of visual code we needed to produce.    
Adapted and learnt quickly as tvOS lacks a lot of the features iOS has, and uses a new indirect interaction model called ‘focus’.

#### Elbi
*05/15 - 10/15*   
**Swift & Objective-C**, iOS, XCTest, CoreData, modules, Cocoapods, Storyboards, IBInspectable.   
Lead developer on [‘Elbi - good on the go’](https://itunes.apple.com/app/elbi-good-on-the-go/id958215274?mt=8).   

Quick micro-actions and donations to bring charities into 21st century.   
Brought in to take the existing prototype ideas to production level. Working closely with UX, design and product to shape the ideas and feedback suggestions. Architected and built the majority of the app, including a way to quickly iterate on designs using IBInspectable.   
Sole developer for the first 4 months, with another contractor coming in to assist with the extra features the company wanted in prelaunch.   
The simple app, featured an increasing amount of complexity, from custom transitions/animations, to a draw/vote/message/photo tool.    
Deadlines set based on an external event (Clintons Global Initiative), rather than the work load, ensured we had to be pragmatic and extremely agile.   


#### Vubiquity
*09/14 - 04/15*   
**Swift**, iOS, MS PlayReady DRM, test driven development, CoreData, modules, build servers, push notifications.   

After Vubiquity purchased FilmFlex, they removed all apps, and started building a video on demand platform.   
We used the latest technology, building multiple prototypes for the sales team. Using a modular design, built to be customised by a CMS, modules such as vouchers, or download manager, could be replaced or removed without requiring developer resource.


#### FilmFlex Movies
*04/12 - 09/14*   
**Objective-C**, iOS, ActiveCloak DRM, CoreData.   

Built a video on demand application, ready to be customised and styled for brands.   
Featured a store, rentals, offline downloads & file management, ActiveCloak DRM, and bespoke features for clients, such as cinema listings, 2 for 1 cinema vouchers, and live video stream of the BAFTAs.   
Also built a prototype inflight entertainment system    

#### Zolmo

Fully customised interface, while matching the feel and experience of the standard UIKit controls.    
Complex Mac AppKit app allowing content team to input recipes, allowing differing ingredients/portion sizes, image scaling, optimisation, and localisation.    
The app was one of the first cooking apps to feature many new features such as in-app purchasing, voice recognition, iCloud, and A/B testing. As well as subtle small details, Instruments/profiling, accessibility and responsiveness.   

Over 10 million active users (as of December 2013).
